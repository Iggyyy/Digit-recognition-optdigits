# Digit recognition 
## Deep Learning supervised clasification 
*** 

### Basic info
#### There is around 5,5k datapoints split into training and testing data. There are three layers, input, hidden and output. I've been adjusting net parameters to get the best results, and atm acurracy is ~89% . 
&nbsp;

#### Net is built with: 
* Gradient descent
* Regularization: batching, dropout
* Activation functions: relu, tanh, softmax  

&nbsp;
#### There is only one library used in project, which is NumPy.

### Project is based on what I've learned from book A. Trask  - Grokking DeepLearning.
